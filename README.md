# UMass Course Review 
(cs326-project-undefined)

This project was created as my final project for CS 326 (Web Programming) at UMass Amherst.

This is a website where users can leave reviews about the CS courses they've taken at UMass Amherst. I was originally going to expand it past the first 6 courses, but I got really burned out from working on this projects for hours on end, so that probbably isn't going to happen anytime soon. Nevertheless, I did learn a lot about building an entire website, including frontend design, backend HTTP requests, working with a database (MongoDB in this caes), and trying (and failing) to deploy onto a remote server (Heroku).
