Application Name: **UMass Course Review**

## Team Overview
Anderson Hsiao: `Anderson-100`

## Application Idea

UMass Amherst students have a lot of opinions about the courses they take. But currently, these reviews are usually transferred through word of mouth or buried within the depths of the internet. Why not compile them into a single website for easy reference by future students?

UMass Course Review will allow students to rate workload, difficulty, and the overall class, as well as post written reviews of their experience. There are a ton of courses at UMass, so I will focus on CS courses first, particularly the lower level requirements (121, 187, 220, 230, 240, 250).

Inspiration from [Unofficial Cornell CS Wiki](https://github.com/CornellCSWiki/CornellCSWiki), [Rate My Professor](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/), and talking with CS friends.

## Functionality

There will be a home page with the list of courses. Clicking on the name of the course will reveal the course's ratings, reviews, and average grades. There will be a button that will pull up a form, which users fill out to add their own review. There will also be a list of professors that have taught the course in the past, and reviews can be filtered by professor(s).

Data to be used:
- classes
- descriptions
- grades
- reviews
- rating
- professors
